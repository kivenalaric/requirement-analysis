# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository is dedicated to documenting and analyzing the requirements of a **Booking Management System** as part of the Requirement Analysis Project.  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Provide a clear and structured approach to requirement analysis.  
- Differentiate functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Represent system interactions visually using diagrams.  
- Define acceptance criteria to align with business and user needs.  

This serves as the foundation for building robust, scalable, and user-focused software systems. 

## What is Requirement Analysis?  

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is one of the most critical phases in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it lays the foundation for the entire project.  

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders work together to clearly define **what the system should do** (functional requirements) and **how it should perform** (non-functional requirements).  

### Importance in the SDLC:
- **Clarity of Goals:** Ensures everyone involved shares the same understanding of the systemâ€™s objectives.  
- **Minimizes Errors:** Detects ambiguities, inconsistencies, and gaps early, reducing costly changes later.  
- **Guides Design & Development:** Acts as a blueprint that shapes the architecture, design, and coding of the system.  
- **Facilitates Communication:** Serves as a bridge between stakeholders and developers, making expectations explicit.  
- **Ensures Quality & Alignment:** Establishes measurable acceptance criteria to confirm the final product meets business and user needs.  

In short, Requirement Analysis is about asking the right questions, documenting precise answers, and ensuring that the system being built is the **right solution to the right problem**.  

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  

Requirement Analysis is not a single step but a series of structured activities that ensure project requirements are accurate, complete, and well understood. The five key activities are:  

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting raw information about the project from stakeholders, users, and existing documentation. This step focuses on identifying what the system should achieve.  

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Engaging stakeholders through techniques like interviews, surveys, brainstorming, workshops, or observation to uncover deeper needs, hidden expectations, and constraints.  

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Organizing and recording the gathered requirements in a clear and structured way, usually in the form of Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents, user stories, or use cases.  

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Examining requirements to identify conflicts, priorities, and dependencies. This often includes creating diagrams (like use case diagrams or data flow diagrams) to model how the system will function.  

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensuring that the documented requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs. This step often involves reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping to confirm accuracy before development begins.  


## Types of Requirements  

In Requirement Analysis, requirements are broadly classified into two categories: **Functional** and **Non-functional**. Both are essential to ensure that the system meets business goals and user expectations.  

### Functional Requirements  

Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**. They define the features, functions, and operations that the system must perform to meet user needs.  

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**  
- Users should be able to create, update, and cancel bookings.  
- The system should allow customers to search for available booking slots by date and time.  
- An administrator should be able to manage resources (e.g., rooms, vehicles, or services) linked to bookings.  
- The system should send confirmation emails or SMS notifications after a booking is made.  
- Users should be able to make payments securely through integrated payment gateways.  

### Non-functional Requirements  

Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform** rather than what it should do. They define quality attributes, constraints, and overall system behavior.  

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**  
- The system should handle at least **500 concurrent users** without performance degradation.  
- Response time for searching available bookings should not exceed **2 seconds**.  
- The system should provide **99.9% uptime** to ensure availability.  
- All sensitive data (user details, payment information) must be **encrypted** both in transit and at rest.  
- The interface should be responsive and accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
