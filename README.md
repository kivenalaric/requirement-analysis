# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository is dedicated to documenting and analyzing the requirements of a **Booking Management System** as part of the Requirement Analysis Project.  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Provide a clear and structured approach to requirement analysis.  
- Differentiate functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Represent system interactions visually using diagrams.  
- Define acceptance criteria to align with business and user needs.  

This serves as the foundation for building robust, scalable, and user-focused software systems.
