# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository is dedicated to documenting and analyzing the requirements of a **Booking Management System** as part of the Requirement Analysis Project.  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Provide a clear and structured approach to requirement analysis.  
- Differentiate functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Represent system interactions visually using diagrams.  
- Define acceptance criteria to align with business and user needs.  

This serves as the foundation for building robust, scalable, and user-focused software systems. 

## What is Requirement Analysis?  

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is one of the most critical phases in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it lays the foundation for the entire project.  

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders work together to clearly define **what the system should do** (functional requirements) and **how it should perform** (non-functional requirements).  

### Importance in the SDLC:
- **Clarity of Goals:** Ensures everyone involved shares the same understanding of the system’s objectives.  
- **Minimizes Errors:** Detects ambiguities, inconsistencies, and gaps early, reducing costly changes later.  
- **Guides Design & Development:** Acts as a blueprint that shapes the architecture, design, and coding of the system.  
- **Facilitates Communication:** Serves as a bridge between stakeholders and developers, making expectations explicit.  
- **Ensures Quality & Alignment:** Establishes measurable acceptance criteria to confirm the final product meets business and user needs.  

In short, Requirement Analysis is about asking the right questions, documenting precise answers, and ensuring that the system being built is the **right solution to the right problem**.  

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it ensures that the system being developed truly meets the needs of stakeholders. Without it, projects risk failure, cost overruns, or delivering solutions that don’t solve the intended problems.  

Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical:  

1. **Prevents Misunderstandings**  
   It creates a clear, shared understanding between stakeholders and developers, reducing the risk of building the wrong solution.  

2. **Saves Time and Cost**  
   By identifying issues, conflicts, and gaps early in the process, Requirement Analysis minimizes costly rework during later stages of development.  

3. **Provides a Blueprint for Development**  
   Requirements act as a foundation for design, coding, and testing. They guide developers in building the system correctly and help testers verify that the final product meets expectations.  

4. **Ensures User Satisfaction** *(bonus point)*  
   Well-defined requirements ensure that the end product addresses real user needs, increasing adoption and long-term success.
